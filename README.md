## Introduction

Introduction
Welcome to ALP SHOP, a web application designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience.
Our platform is built using a combination of PHP and JavaScript, leveraging the strengths of each language 
for server-side database interaction and client-side rendering, respectively.

Technologies Used:
PHP: Powers the backend server, handling database interactions, user authentication, and server-side logic.
JavaScript: Enables dynamic client-side rendering, enhancing user interactivity and responsiveness.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript, used to communicate between the client-side and server-side scripts, facilitating seamless data exchange.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install XAMPP**: If you haven't already, download and install XAMPP, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, which includes Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in PHP and Perl.

   - You can download XAMPP from the official website: [XAMPP Download Page](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

2. **Download the Zip File**: Clone or download the repository as a zip file from the project's GitHub repository.

3. **Extract the Contents**: Once downloaded, extract the contents of the zip file into a new folder. You can choose any location on your computer for this folder.

4. **Move to XAMPP's htdocs Directory**: Locate your XAMPP installation directory and navigate to the `htdocs` folder. This is typically located in the installation directory of XAMPP (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows, `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on macOS).

5. **Move Project Folder**: Move the folder containing the extracted contents of the zip file into the `htdocs` directory. This folder will serve as the root directory for your project within the XAMPP environment.

6. **Start XAMPP**: Launch the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking on their respective "Start" buttons.

7. **Open PHPMyAdmin**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`. This will open PHPMyAdmin, a web-based administration tool for managing MySQL databases.

8. **Create a New Database**: Within PHPMyAdmin, create a new database by clicking on the "Databases" tab, entering a name for the database (matching the SQL file included in the zip alp-shop.sql ), and clicking on "Create".

9. **Import SQL Schema**: With the newly created database selected, click on the "Import" tab. Choose the SQL file (alp-shop.sql) included in the zip and click "Go" to import the schema and populate the database with necessary tables and data.

10. **Access the Project**: Once the database import is complete, access your project by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost/[project-folder-name]`, where `[project-folder-name]` is the name of the folder you moved into the `htdocs` directory.

Now you should be able to access and explore the project locally on your machine using XAMPP.
